# Probability Essentials for Deep Learning - Code Explanation

This document explains the `probability_basics.py` file, which demonstrates fundamental probability concepts essential for understanding deep learning algorithms.

## Overview

The code covers core probability operations using only NumPy, making it lightweight and educational. It demonstrates:

- **Random variables & distributions** - Sampling from different probability distributions
- **Expectation & variance** - Monte Carlo estimation of statistical moments
- **Law of Large Numbers** - Convergence of sample means to population means
- **Bayes rule** - Application to diagnostic testing scenarios

## Core Functions Explained

### 1. Sampling from Distributions

```python
def sample_distributions(seed=0, n=10000):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    normals = rng.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=n)
    uniforms = rng.uniform(low=-1.0, high=1.0, size=n)
    bernoulli = rng.binomial(1, 0.3, size=n)
    print("samples -> normal mean≈", normals.mean(), " uniform mean≈", uniforms.mean(), " bernoulli p̂≈", bernoulli.mean())
    return normals, uniforms, bernoulli
```

**What it does:** Generates samples from three different probability distributions.

**Distributions sampled:**

1. **Normal (Gaussian) distribution:**
   - **Parameters:** `loc=0.0` (mean), `scale=1.0` (standard deviation)
   - **Shape:** Bell-shaped, symmetric around mean
   - **Use cases:** Modeling measurement errors, natural phenomena, neural network weights

2. **Uniform distribution:**
   - **Parameters:** `low=-1.0`, `high=1.0` (range)
   - **Shape:** Flat, equal probability across range
   - **Use cases:** Random initialization, Monte Carlo integration, fairness

3. **Bernoulli distribution:**
   - **Parameters:** `n=1` (single trial), `p=0.3` (success probability)
   - **Shape:** Binary outcomes (0 or 1)
   - **Use cases:** Binary classification, coin flips, success/failure events

**Key concepts:**
- **Random number generator (RNG):** `np.random.default_rng(seed)` for reproducible randomness
- **Sample size:** `n=10000` provides good statistical estimates
- **Sample statistics:** `mean()` estimates the true population mean

### 2. Expectation and Variance Estimation

```python
def expectation_variance(samples):
    mean = np.mean(samples)
    var = np.var(samples, ddof=0)
    print("E[X]≈", mean, " Var[X]≈", var)
    return mean, var
```

**What it does:** Estimates the expected value (mean) and variance of a random variable from samples.

**Expected value (mean):**
- **Mathematical formula:** `E[X] = ∫ x·f(x)dx` (continuous) or `E[X] = Σ x·P(X=x)` (discrete)
- **Sample estimate:** `mean = (1/n) × Σ x_i`
- **Interpretation:** Center of mass of the distribution

**Variance:**
- **Mathematical formula:** `Var[X] = E[(X - E[X])²] = E[X²] - (E[X])²`
- **Sample estimate:** `var = (1/n) × Σ(x_i - mean)²`
- **Interpretation:** Spread or dispersion around the mean

**Parameter `ddof=0`:**
- **ddof=0:** Population variance (divide by n)
- **ddof=1:** Sample variance (divide by n-1, unbiased estimator)

### 3. Law of Large Numbers Demo

```python
def law_of_large_numbers(seed=1, n=100000):
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    p = 0.37
    xs = rng.binomial(1, p, size=n)
    running_means = np.cumsum(xs) / np.arange(1, n+1)
    print("Final running mean (should approach p=0.37):", running_means[-1])
    return running_means
```

**What it does:** Demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) using Bernoulli trials.

**The setup:**
- **True probability:** `p = 0.37` (37% chance of success)
- **Sample size:** `n = 100,000` Bernoulli trials
- **Running means:** `cumsum(xs) / arange(1, n+1)` computes mean after each trial

**Law of Large Numbers:**
- **Weak LLN:** Sample mean converges to population mean in probability
- **Strong LLN:** Sample mean converges to population mean almost surely
- **Mathematical statement:** `lim_{n→∞} (1/n) × Σ X_i = E[X]` with probability 1

**Why this matters:**
- **Statistical estimation:** Larger samples give more accurate estimates
- **Monte Carlo methods:** Approximate integrals and expectations
- **Machine learning:** Training on more data improves performance

### 4. Bayes Rule Example

```python
def bayes_rule_example(prior=0.01, sens=0.95, spec=0.98):
    """Posteriors for a positive test: P(Disease|Positive)."""
    p_pos = prior*sens + (1-prior)*(1-spec)
    posterior = (prior*sens) / p_pos
    print(f"Prior={prior}, Sens={sens}, Spec={spec} -> P(Disease|Positive)≈ {posterior:.4f}")
    return posterior
```

**What it does:** Applies Bayes' rule to calculate the probability of having a disease given a positive test result.

**Parameters:**
- **Prior probability:** `P(Disease) = 0.01` (1% of population has disease)
- **Sensitivity:** `P(Positive|Disease) = 0.95` (95% of diseased test positive)
- **Specificity:** `P(Negative|No Disease) = 0.98` (98% of healthy test negative)

**Bayes' rule calculation:**
1. **Total positive probability:** `P(Positive) = P(Disease)×Sens + P(No Disease)×(1-Spec)`
2. **Posterior probability:** `P(Disease|Positive) = (P(Disease)×Sens) / P(Positive)`

**Mathematical formula:** `P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)`

**The result:** Even with a positive test, the probability of having the disease is much lower than expected due to the low prior probability (base rate fallacy).

    print("== Probability Essentials ==")
    normals, uniforms, bernoulli = sample_distributions()  # Generate samples
    expectation_variance(normals)                          # Estimate moments
    law_of_large_numbers()                                # Show convergence

### Estimation Theory

- **Bias:** Difference between expected estimate and true value
- **Variance:** Spread of estimates around expected value
- **Mean squared error:** `MSE = Bias² + Variance`
- **Consistency:** Estimates converge to true value as sample size increases
