**Key Components:**

- **Weights (w):** Indicate how important each input is.
- **Bias (wâ‚€):** Provides a baseline adjustment to the neuron's output.
- **Activation function (g):** Introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to model complex relationships (not just straight lines).

**How a Neural Network Processes Data:**

1. **Input:**  
   - You provide data to the network (often visualized as blue nodes).

2. **Forward Pass:**  
   - Each neuron in a layer receives numbers from the previous layer.
   - It multiplies each input by its corresponding weight (importance).
   - Adds the bias (adjustment).
   - Applies the activation function to determine its output (how "active" it should be).

3. **Hidden Layers:**  
   - The data is processed step-by-step through one or more hidden layers (often shown as red nodes).

4. **Output:**  
   - The network produces a prediction or result (often shown as purple nodes).

5. **Learning (Training):**  
   - If the prediction is incorrect, the network adjusts its weights and biases to improve next time.
   - This process repeats thousands or millions of times, gradually making the network better at its task.
