# Deep Neural Networks (DNN) - Complete Guide

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks characterized by having multiple layers of interconnected neurons between the input and output. They form the backbone of modern deep learning, powering breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.

## üéØ What is a Deep Neural Network?

A DNN consists of an input layer, two or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer transforms its input using learned weights, biases, and non-linear activation functions, enabling the network to model highly complex and abstract relationships in data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multiple Hidden Layers:** DNNs contain several hidden layers (not just one), allowing them to learn hierarchical and abstract representations of data.
- **Non-linear Activations:** Each neuron applies a non-linear activation function (such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh), enabling the network to capture complex, non-linear patterns.
- **End-to-End Learning:** DNNs can learn directly from raw or minimally processed data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
- **Universal Approximation:** With enough layers and neurons, DNNs can approximate any continuous function, making them extremely powerful for a wide range of tasks.
